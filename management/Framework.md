# City Data Model and Reference Architecture: Framework

## Scope of this document
This document defines the architectural framework of the City Data Model and Reference Architecture. This document is intended to be an [Evergreen Standard](Evergreen).

### Purpose of CDMRA

The purpose of the CDMRA is to:

1. assist experts in producing and building consensus around the definitions that are eventually captured in the city data model (CDM) portion of the CDMRA and
2. provide users of these data definitions the necessary context of the data so that they can fully appreciate the intent of the data.

These dual purposes are achieved by supplementing the CDM with the Use Case and Interface Specification Views, which provide justification and context for the data defined by the CDM.

The CDMRA formally defines the CDM; the other components of the CDMRA are only developed to the extent to support the needs of the CDM.

### Purpose of the CDM

The CDM A city data model enables city software applications to share information, plan, coordinate, and execute city tasks, and support decision making, by providing a precise, unambiguous representation of information and knowledge commonly shared within and across city services.

### Scope of services covered by the CDMRA (and CDM)

The CDMRA, and by inclusion the CDM, intends to provide a central reference for data definitions used within smart cities. However, it should be recognized that:

- smart cities encompass a huge number of potential services, including those for transport, health care, governance, power, etc.
- the CDMRA project is relatively new (starting in 2020)
- its content is dependent on the contributions of experts from the various areas of smart city services

As present, most of the work is focused on smart transport, including intelligent transport systems and transport planning, but the intent is to include all city services and experts from other service areas are encouraged to contribute.

In fact, the governance process envisioned by this document recognizes that the development of data definitions for any one smart city service often needs to consider the needs of other smart city services so that the data defined by one service can be reused by another. For example, a transport service might monitor the location of a vehicle, but a health care service might need access to that location information if a vehicle occupant has a health issue. If the two services are to be properly integrated, both the transport domain and the health care domain need to agree on how location should be defined, which requires experts from both domains to be involved in the definition of location data.

### Scope of technical specification

The CDMRA intends to define the semantics of city data to a level of detail such that it can be used as a reference for data transformations from one interface format to another. For example, it will define the meaning of data, the relationships among data, and the preferred units for data (or mechanisms for defining units of measure).

The CDM does not attempt to define representational form, encoding formats, or protocols used to exchange the data. However, before any element of the model is fully &quot;approved&quot;, at least one interface specification providing these rules must be identified and registered in the CDMRA. This ensures that the definitions provided in the model reflect real-world usage.

It is envisioned that data transformations will be defined to translate data from specific protocols into their corresponding data elements contained within the CDM. Such transformation rules will facilitate the unambiguous translation of data among different protocols and avoid mistakes in translations. The CDMRA collaboration environment makes provisions to store this type of information but this information is not currently the focus of the CDMRA development.

## Understanding the Model

While the primary goal of the CDMRA is to formally define the CDM, learning the contents of a data model by itself is a bit like trying to learn a language by reading a dictionary. In practice, data models are most useful when presented in small chunks that can be directly related to a practical use of the data.

To promote comprehension, the CDMRA adopts a use-case approach to defining data. The use cases are defined within the Use Case View of the CDMRA using a standard template. Each use case identifies the data required by the use case and typically includes one or more class diagrams that depict the relationships among this data.

The Use Case View also includes hyperlinks into the Information View, which provides additional details about the data, including:

1. Detailed definitions of each data concept required by the use case (the City Data Model)
2. Diagrams depicting how this data relates to other data (e.g., data that might not be used by the specific use case)
3. Links to each use case that uses each data element
4. Identification of interface specifications within the Interface View that define how the data is implemented in real-world interfaces
5. Links to outside resources that provide additional context for the data (e.g., external reference architectures)

The various parts of the CDMRA are summarized in Figure 1.

## Framework

The framework specification contained in this specification conforms to an *architecture framework* as specified in [ISO 42010](ISO42010). Specifically, the document identifies a set of *viewpoints*, each of which is designed to address a specific set of *concerns* held by *stakeholders*. The viewpoints are defined using *model kinds*, which specify modeling conventions to be used for specific presentations of the data. 

According to ISO/IEC/IEEE [ISO 42010](ISO42010), an architecture viewpoint establishes "the conventions for the construction, interpretation, and use of architecture views to frame specific system concerns."

An *architecture description* based on this framework will develop *models* conforming to the model kinds defined by this document and group the models into *views* that correspond to the viewpoints defined in this document. 

The viewpoint specifications are based on the [Viewpoint Specification Template](Hilliard1). 

The Use Case Viewpoint specification has been developed in consideration ofÂ input based on [Hiiliard2](Hiiliard2), [Kruchten](Kruchten), and [IEEE2413](IEEE2413).

The Information Viewpoint specification was developed in consideration of the specifications defined in [Software Systems Architecture](Rozanski), the [Department of Defense Architecture Framework](DoDAF), [The Open Group Architecture Framework](TOGAF), and the [Zachman Framework](Zachman).

The Interface Specification Viewpoint was developed based on the needs of the CDMRA.

### Usage Viewpoint

#### Overview

The Usage Viewpoint defines the conventions for capturing how city data might be used to meet the needs of various system actors. 

#### Concerns and Stakeholders

Example stakeholders might include [Rozanski]:

-   Developers
-   System Administrators
-   Testers
-   Users

#### Concerns

|Concern|Addressed by Model Kind|
|-------|-----------------------|
|What are the use cases that are driving the data definitions?|Use Case Specification: Use case, Summary, Description, and Illustration|
|Is the use case definition collaboratory or copyrighted elsewhere?|License information|
|What is the context of this use case?|Use Case Specification: domain, sub-domain, goal|
|Who are the stakeholders for this use case?|Use Case Specification: participants and other stakeholders|
|What data needs to be provided by participants?|Use Case Specification: Information requirements<br /><br /><span style="background:yellow">Do we really need to separate input/output? Where do we declare our system boundary? I propose that each use case should define its own system boundary as narrow as possible. For example, in the case of "Routes for Travellers" the suggested route is likely to consider current traffic conditions. The current traffic conditions could be determined by a number of means (e.g., sensors in the field, video image processing, Bluetooth travel times, cellular-based travel times), each of which have slighly different architectures. From the point of this use case, it doesn't matter - the only thing that is important is that a "Transporation Information Center" provides current network conditions and how that data is obtained is irrelavent. A different use case might need more details and would define a different system boundary </span>|

|<span style="background:yellow">What data needs to be generated/accessed internally to the smart city system?</span>|TBD<br /><br /><span style="background:yellow">If we define internal flows, we need to define internal elements and this is no longer a use case specification - but perhaps what we are trying to achieve is primarily standardizing data among major system components. Thus, perhaps we need at least a high-level deployment viewpoint that at least identifies the major system components that we will consider in our analysis. Actually, the best way to handle this within the scope of our environment is to define a separate use case where the boundary changes so that one of the component systems is defined as an actor.</span>|

#### Concerns not addressed

This viewpoint does not attempt to frame the following stakeholder
concerns:

<span style="background:yellow">Any?</span>

####Model Kinds

The Usage Viewpoint includes two model kinds:

- Use case model kind
- Scenario model kind

Each use case model shall be associated with one or more scenario models, which provide additional details about the use case; scenario models are generally specific to a single use case.

#### Use Case Model Kind

The use case model kind provides a template that is to be used to define all use cases defined within the Usage View. The template is defined as follows:

|Field|Description|Conformance|
|-----|-----------|-----------|
|Domain|Major domain (e.g., ITS)|
|Subdomain|Area of domain that this use case represents (e.g., Vehicle safety)|
|Use case |Name of use case <span style="background:yellow">We could perhaps combine the domain, subdomain, and use case into one hierarchical field</span>||
|Summary|Short description (\<= 280 characters)|
|Description|A more extended description of the use case. The purpose of the CDMRA is to develop the data model, as such, the description does not need to provide full details, but it should provide sufficient context to provide insight into the data that needs to be exchanged and processed.|

##### Operations for Use Case Models

When initially creating a use case model, the following fields shall be populated, as a minimum, prior to considering the use case definition complete:

- Domain
- Subdomain
- Use case
- Summary 
- Description
- Goal
- Participants
- Other stakeholders
- At least one scenario

##### Correspondence Rules for Use Case Models

Each use case model shall correspond to at least one scenario model. All corresponding scenario models shall be linked via the Scenarios field of the use case model.

#### Scenario Model Kind

|Field|Description|Conformance|
|-----|-----------|-----------|
|Use case|Link to the use case model|
|Scenario name|Name of scenario|
|Pre-conditions|Any conditions that must be true prior to this scenario occuring|
|Triggers|Event(s) that cause this scenario to occur|
|Event flow|The sequence of events that occur during this scenario|
|Post-conditions|Any conditions that must be true after the completion of this scenario|
|Exceptions|Highlighted, potential undesirable outcomes identifying positions within the flow of events where they can occur <span style="background:yellow">Perhaps we roll this table into the main table and use this field to explain any data that might be needed in alternate flows?</span>|
|Interaction diagram|<span style="background:yellow">This is really a deployment view model kind</span>|

##### Operations for Scenario Models

All of the fields of the scenario model should be populated upon creating the model, but in some cases, some information might not apply. At a minimum, the following fields should be populated for all scenarios:

- Use case
- Scenario name
- Event flow

##### Correspondence Rules for Scenario Models

Each scenario model shall be associated with at least (and typically only) one use case model. The use case model(s) shall be linked via the Use Case field of the scenario model.

#### Operations for Usage Views

When creating a new usage view, care should be taken to create a system where use cases can be catalogued in a manner that users can easily search and find use cases of interest. This should likely be done by standardizing the list of domains and subdomains.

#### Correspondence Rules for Usage Views

The usage view includes the following correspondence rules with other views and resources:

- The domain and subdomain values used within each use case model should be selected from pre-defined lists
- Participants and other stakeholders should be defined in a separately maintained list
- The source should cite a publicly available document
- The specicifications shall cite an entry in the specification view
- The information flow class diagram shall be a diagram showing only those elements from the Information View that are relevant to this use case
- The interaction diagram of the scenario model might also be contained within a deployment or similar view of another reference architecture

#### Example

#### Model Kinds

According to ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010, concerns are framed by viewpoints by
using one or more model kinds, where a model kind establishes the
conventions for a type of modeling. The model kind governs the
development of a model, which addresses some portion of the stakeholder
concerns that are framed by the viewpoint. The Information Viewpoint
consists of the following model kinds:\

-   Vocabulary Model Kind
-   Ontology Model Kind
-   Logical Data Model Kind
-   Data Dictionary Model Kind
-   State Machine Model Kind
-   Physical Data Model Kind

Model Kinds not included at present:

-   Data Ownership Model Kind
-   Information Lifecycle Model Kind
-   Timeliness and Latency Model Kind
-   Archive and Retention Model Kind

#### Vocabulary Model Kind

The Vocabulary Model Kind is used to provide formal definitions of key
business terms. Formal definitions should be developed according to the
principles defined in ISO 704. 

Roughly equivalent to IEEE 2413 semantic model kind

##### Conventions

The Vocabulary Model Kind is presented as a template providing the following static metadata for each entry.

-   Term
-   English Definition

Optional static metadata for each entity and relationship includes\

-   Preferred Synonym(s)
-   Admitted Synonym(s)
-   Deprecated Synonym(s)\
-   Note(s)
-   Example(s)\

##### Operations

##### Correspondence Rules


#### Ontology Model Kind\

The Ontology Model Kind is used to specify relationships among key business terms. It is roughly equivalent to IEEE 2413 semantic model kind.

##### Conventions\

The Ontology Model Kind is graphically represented using UML class diagrams and formally defined using RDF/XML (or perhaps we want to use the Functional-Style syntax defined in the OWL2 specification as it is more concise?). It is expected that there will be one (or perhaps a
small number of) RDF/XML file(s) while there will be a large number of ontology diagrams.

UML class diagrams should be limited to no more than 20 classes.

Define a UML class diagram profile

##### Operations

##### Correspondence Rules


#### Logical Data Model Kind\

The Logical Data Model Kind is used to specify relationships among
entries contained within the LDD. \
 UML class diagram; three variations\

-   Class focus
-   Information flow focus (Information flow model kind of IEEE 2413)\
-   Component - Information flow focus

Attributes to be considered (somewhere)\

-   Does the data need to be stored with supplemental authentication
    information? E.g., an RSU might broadcast a MAP message to vehicles,
    but that MAP message must be signed by a mapping authority\

##### Conventions

Data element specification includes:\

-   Definition \
-   See ISO 14817-1\

##### Operations

##### Correspondence Rules
Each business entity shall trace to one entry within the Logical Data
Dictionary (LDD). The tool should default to having the link point to a
class in the Logical Data Dictionary having the identical name of the
business entity with the option to override this link to another class
or LDD entry.

#### Data Dictionary Model Kind\

The Data Dictionary Model Kind is used to specify static metadata about
data concepts. Data concepts include:

-   Class
-   Data object: characteristic of a class with an explicit value
    domain
-   Value domain: expression of the range of values that a
    characteristic can have
-   Information object: logical grouping of data elements that is useful
    for information storage or transfer

NOTE: A data object might be elemental in nature and represent a single
indivisible concept (e.g., Vehicle.speed:measure-mps), in which case it
is a data element. Alternatively, a data object might represent a
composition of information (e.g., Vehicle.position:GeoLocation3D, which
includes a latitude, longitude, and elevation), in which case it
represents an association role to another class.\

##### Conventions

Data concept specifications can include the following static metadata
based on type. Within the table, an "M" indicates that the metadata is
mandatory, an "O" indicates that it is optional, and a "N/A" indicates
that it is not applicable to the type of data concept. Metadata items
that are shown in italics indicate that the values represent
correspondences to another architectural element. Metadata options that
are shown with an optional plural name indicate that multiple instances
of the metadata item are allowed.\

|  Metadata|                     Class|   Data Object|   Value Domain|   Information Object|
|-----------------------------|--------|--------------|---------------|---------------------|

##### Signer - metadata to be added for each information transfer(?)\

This identifies the physical object that has the authority to issue the
information object (i.e., which indicates who should sign the
information object).Â  \

##### Inspiration

Identifies the This includes both the identifier and name of a service
that uses the information as well as an assessment of how
safety-critical the information is.\

##### Usage: service

This includes both the identifier and name of a service that uses the
information as well as an assessment of how safety-critical the
information is.\

##### Usage: external link

This provides a link to an external resource that identifies an
architectural element that relies upon this information; it is coupled
with an assessment of how safety-critical the information is within the
context of that usage. Examples of external resources that might use
information defined within the information view include:\

-   A functional view process
-   A functional view data store\
-   A deployment view information flow (e.g., which might identify
    sources and sinks for the flow)\

##### Physical Representation\

This includes both the name of a corresponding data element contained in
a Physical Data Model coupled with a (preferably mathematical)
definition of how to transform the Physical Data Model data element into
the Logical Data Model data element.\

##### Operations



#### Information structure model kind

SysML Internal Block Diagram\
 IEEE 2413\

#### State Machine Model Kind

The State Machine Model Kind is used to specify the behavior of a class
as it transitions among various states.

##### Conventions

The state machine shall be defined using a UML State Machine diagram
accompanied by text explaining the bahavior of the class within each
state and the characteristics of each state transition. \

##### Operation

##### Operations

##### Correspondence Rules

Each element of the PDM should trace to a element of the Logical Data
model with a justification for any transormation that needs to occur\

#### Data Ownership Model Kind

[[Rozanski]] provides the following \

RozanskiAndWoods-Architecture-Description-Template

If data is owned by more than one entity or part of the system, define
who owns which pieces of the data and explain how any resulting problems
will be handled.

In the example below, it can be seen that there are issues with entity 4
which can be updated by System D which is not the owner. The AD should
explain how this inconsistency will be managed.

**Entity**

**System A**

**System B**

**System C**

**System D**

#### Information Lifecycle Model Kind

#### Timeliness and Latency Model Kind\

If information needs to be copied around the system or is updated
regularly, explain how timeliness and latency requirements will be
addressed.\

#### Archive and Retention

Explain how will archive and retention requirements will be met by the
system.\

#### Operations on Views

#### Correspondence Rules

All information referenced in other views shall be consistent with the
content of the Information View.\

All information referenced in other views should be traced to elements
within the Information View. The "should" within this statement allows
for the preferred development process where use cases are defined prior
to developing the detailed data definitions. \

Primary\
 Information is produced by functions\
 Data (of Information) is consumed by the logical structure of functions
(per RA for Space Data Systems)\
 \
 Secondary\
 Enterprise, Functional, Physical, and Communication Viewpoints might
all reference data that might need to be stored in the system; when
these links are needed, there will be information flows in the Physical
View. We could include hyperlinks to these other views - but more likely
(esp. given the connection between two systems) the link from the Smart
City Data Model will be only to the Information Flows of remote
Communication Views and the local Use Case View.\
