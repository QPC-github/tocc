# City Data Model and Reference Architecture: Framework

## Scope of this document

This document defines the architectural framework of the City Data Model and Reference Architecture. This document is intended to be an [Evergreen Standard](Evergreen).

### Purpose of CDMRA

The purpose of the CDMRA is to:

1. assist experts in producing and building consensus around the definitions that are eventually captured in the city data model (CDM) portion of the CDMRA and
2. provide users of these data definitions the necessary context of the data so that they can fully appreciate the intent of the data.

These dual purposes are achieved by supplementing the CDM with the Use Case and Interface Specification Views, which provide justification and context for the data defined by the CDM.

The CDMRA formally defines the CDM; the other components of the CDMRA are only developed to the extent to support the needs of the CDM.

### Purpose of the CDM

The CDM enables city software applications to share information, plan, coordinate, and execute city tasks, and support decision making, by providing a precise, unambiguous representation of information and knowledge commonly shared within and across city services.

### Scope of services covered by the CDMRA (and CDM)

The CDMRA, and by inclusion the CDM, intends to provide a central reference for data definitions used within smart cities. However, it should be recognized that:

- smart cities encompass a huge number of potential services, including those for transport, health care, governance, power, etc.
- the CDMRA project is relatively new (starting in 2020)
- its content is dependent on the contributions of experts from the various areas of smart city services

At present, most of the work is focused on smart transport, including intelligent transport systems and transport planning, but the intent is to include all city services and experts from other service areas are encouraged to contribute.

In fact, the governance process envisioned by this document recognizes that the development of data definitions for any one smart city service often needs to consider the needs of other smart city services so that the data defined by one service can be reused by another. For example, a transport service might monitor the location of a vehicle, but a health care service might need access to that location information if a vehicle occupant has a health issue. If the two services are to be properly integrated, both the transport domain and the health care domain need to agree on how location should be defined, which requires experts from both domains to be involved in the definition of location data.

### Scope of technical specification

The CDMRA intends to define the semantics of city data to a level of detail such that it can be used as a reference for data transformations from one interface format to another. For example, it will define the meaning of data, the relationships among data, and the preferred units for data (or mechanisms for defining units of measure).

The CDM does not attempt to define representational form, encoding formats, or protocols used to exchange the data. However, before any element of the model is fully &quot;approved&quot;, at least one interface specification providing these rules must be identified and registered in the CDMRA. This ensures that the definitions provided in the model reflect real-world usage.

It is envisioned that data transformations will be defined to translate data from specific protocols into their corresponding data elements contained within the CDM. Such transformation rules will facilitate the unambiguous translation of data among different protocols and avoid mistakes in translations. The CDMRA collaboration environment makes provisions to store this type of information but this information is not currently the focus of the CDMRA development.

## Understanding the City Data Model and Reference Architecture

While the primary goal of the CDMRA is to formally define the CDM, learning the contents of a data model by itself is a bit like trying to learn a language by reading a dictionary. In practice, data models are most useful when presented in small chunks that can be directly related to a practical use of the data.

To promote comprehension, the CDM is developed as one view of a larger reference architecture (RA), which was developed according to the rules of ISO 42010 (*System and software engineering â€” Architecture description*). The CDMRA provides a use-case-driven approach to defining data. The use cases are defined within the Use Case View of the CDMRA using a standard template. Each use case identifies the data required by the use case and typically references one or more information flow class diagrams that depict the relationships among this data.

The Use Case View also includes hyperlinks into the Information View, which provides details about the data, including:

1. Detailed definitions of each data concept required by the use case (the City Data Model)
2. Subjecxtc area class diagrams depicting how this data relates to other data (e.g., data that might not be used by the specific use case)
3. Reverse links to each use case that uses each class/property
4. Identification of interface specifications within the Interface Specification View that define how the data is implemented in real-world interfaces
5. Links to outside resources that provide additional context for the data (e.g., external reference architectures)

The various parts of the CDMRA are summarized in Figure 1.

</figure>

## Terms and definitions

The development and uses of the CDMRA crosses several domains, with different stakeholder groups familiar with their own vocabulary. For example, an entity that describes a group of objects that exhibit similar characteristics might be called a:

- unary predicate in First Order Logic (FOL)
- concept in Description Logic (DL)
- class in Web Ontology Language (OWL), Unified Modeling Language (UML), and in the vocabulary of ISO 11179 (Metadata registries)
- entity in entity-relationship diagrams
- table in database terminology
- aggregate business information entity (ABIE) in UN/CEFACT (https://unece.org/DAM/cefact/codesfortrade/CCTS/CCTS-Version3.pdf)

The CDMRA is heavily based on OWL and the Ontology Definition Metamodel (ODM), which itself is based on UML; therefore the CDMRA typically adopts the terms used by these standards to the extent practical. Synonyms from other communities are noted in the definitions below along with explanations on how different terms might have slightly different meanings. In some cases, we have also adopted terms from other communities to try to be as precise as possible.

## Framework

The framework specification contained in this specification conforms to an *architecture framework* as specified in [ISO 42010](ISO42010) and depicted in the figure below. Specifically, the document identifies a set of *viewpoints*, each of which is designed to address a specific set of *concerns* held by *stakeholders*. The viewpoints are defined using *model kinds*, which specify modeling conventions to be used for specific presentations of the data. 

<figure class="image"><img src="Framework.png"><figcaption>Figure 2: Framework relationships</figcaption></figure>

According to ISO/IEC/IEEE [ISO 42010](ISO42010), an architecture viewpoint establishes "the conventions for the construction, interpretation, and use of architecture views to frame specific system concerns."

An *architecture description* based on this framework will develop *models* conforming to the model kinds defined by this document and group the models into *views* that correspond to the viewpoints defined in this document. As multiple viewpoints might share similar concerns, the same model kinds and models can be referenced by multiple viewpoints and views.

The viewpoint specifications are based on the [Viewpoint Specification Template](Hilliard1). 

The Use Case Viewpoint specification has been developed in consideration ofÂ input based on [Hiiliard2](Hiiliard2), [Kruchten](Kruchten), and [IEEE2413](IEEE2413).

The Information Viewpoint specification was developed in consideration of the specifications defined in [Software Systems Architecture](Rozanski), the [Department of Defense Architecture Framework](DoDAF), [The Open Group Architecture Framework](TOGAF), and the [Zachman Framework](Zachman).

The Interface Specification Viewpoint was developed based on the needs of the CDMRA.

### Use Case Viewpoint

#### Overview

The use case viewpoint defines the conventions for capturing how city data might be used to meet the needs of various system actors. 

#### Concerns and Stakeholders

Example stakeholders might include [Rozanski]:

- Developers
- System Administrators
- Testers
- Users

#### Concerns

The following table provides an overview of the stakeholder concerns addressed by this viewpoint along with a specific reference to the model kind (and field) or correspondence rule that addresses the concern.

|Concern|Addressed by Model Kind|
|-------|-----------------------|
|What are the use cases that are driving the data definitions?|Use Case Specification: Name, Summary, Description, and Supplementary Figures|
|Is the use case definition collaboratory or copyrighted elsewhere?|Use Case Specification: Licensing Information, Other Licensing Notes|
|What is the context of this use case?|Use Case Specification: Domain, Name|
|Who are the participants for this use case?|Use Case Specification: Actors|
|What data needs to be exchanged among participants?|Use Case Specification: Information Requirements, Required Classes, Required Object Properties, Required Data Properties, Supplementary Figures, Normative Figures|
|What are the flow of events for each scenario associated with each use case?|Use Case Specification: Basic Flow of Events, Flow Exceptions|
|What are the outstanding issues with this use case?|Use Case Specification: Issues|
|What is the source of this use case?|Use Case Specification: Reference(s)|
|What standards/specifications exist related to this use case?|Use Case Specification: Relevant Specifications|
|How has this use case evolved over time?|Use Case Specification: Page History|
|What is the approval status of this use case?|Use Case Specification: Use Case Status|

#### Concerns not addressed

This viewpoint does not attempt to frame the following stakeholder
concerns:

- What non-participating stakeholders exist for this use case?

#### Model Kinds

The use case viewpoint includes two defined model kinds:

- Use case model kind
- Information flow class diagram model kind

Each use case shall be associated with one use case specification model. Each use case specification model may be associated with zero or more information flow class diagram models. Each information flow class diagram model depicts the information from the CDM that is used by the use case; an information flow class diagram model can be associated with multiple use cases. 

Information flow class diagram models depict the content of the City Data Model; thus, the typical work flow is:

1. The use case specification is developed
2. A notional information flow class diagram is conceptualized (i.e., the notional model is likely to be a "supplemental figure" that is not fully integrated with the CDM)
3. The notional information flow class diagram is harmonized with the existing content of the CDM (i.e., part of the Information View); this might entail adding new data elements to the CDM, revising existing data elements, and revising the notional information flow class diagram model to conform to the revised CDM
4. Developing a final information flow class diagram model
5. Linking the information flow class diagram model with the use case specification

Thus, initial versions of a use case model are likely not to include an information flow class diagram model or might only include a notional diagram.  However, once fully specified, the use case model should provide `a link to the information flow class diagram model, which will be fully consistent with the content of the CDM.` The information flow class diagram model kind is a part of both the Use Case Viewpoint and the Information Viewpoint and is formally defined in the Information Viewpoint section.


#### Use Case Model Kind

The use case model kind provides a template that is to be used to define all use cases defined within the use case view. The template is defined as follows:

|Field|Description|Conformance|
|-----|-----------|-----------|
| **Use Case Name** |Name of use case|Mandatory|
| **Domain** | One of: Government, Transportation, Education, Healthcare, Home, Campus| Mandatory|
| **Summary** |Short description (\<= 280 characters). <br />The summary should identify the goal and one or more value proposition(s) in the form **Â«[\<Verb\>] \<direct object\>Â»** <br />For example: <br />This use case describes how a user might plan a driving trip from a source to a destination. This use case focuses on ensuring the following user benefits: <ul><li>[Improve] travel efficiency</li><li>[Improve] driver expectations</li><li>[Reduce] driver confusion</li></ul>|Mandatory|
| **Description** |A more extended description of the use case. The purpose of the CDMRA is to develop the data model, as such, the description does not need to provide full details, but it should provide sufficient context to provide insight into the data that needs to be exchanged and processed.|Mandatory|
|**Actors**|Parties that directly interact with the system for this use case.|Mandatory|
|**Basic Flow of Events**|The sequence of events that occur during the normal flow of this use case with any notes.|Mandatory|
| **Flow Exceptions** |Highlighted alternative flow of events that reveal the need for additional data to be exchanged among the actors of the use case.|Optional|
| **Information Requirements** |This is a very high-level description, for example, "origin location, destination location, and travel preferences". Details can be hashed out later and shown in the diagrams; this can be updated later to provide correspondence linkages to the defined data concepts in the Information View. While not technically required to define a use case, this field should be populated prior to beginning work on the data definitions|Optional|
|**Required Classes**|Links to CDM classes. Should eventually be populated once CDM contains data for use case.|Optional|
|**Required Object Properties**|Links to CDM. Should eventually be populated once CDM contains data for use case.|Optional|
|**Required Data Properties**|Links to CDM. Should eventually be populated once CDM contains data for use case.|Optional|
| **Issues** |Primarily to track issues during development|Optional|
| **Reference(s)** |Source materials used to develop this use case|Optional|
| **Relevant Specifications** |Link to reference architectures, standards and other resources that rely upon this use case definition|Optional|
| **License information** |Indicate the owner and provide a reference to the copyright information|Mandatory|
| **Other Licensing Notes**|Additional information related to licensing|Optional|
| **Use Case Status** |Approval status|Mandatory|
| **Supplementary Figures** |One or more illustrations that might assist the user in better understanding the scenario. Each illustration should be explained by either the description or the flow of events.|Optional|

##### Operations for Use Case Models

When initially creating a use case model, the following fields shall be populated, as a minimum, prior to considering the use case definition complete:

- Name
- Domain
- Summary
- Description
- Actors
- Basic flow of events
- License information
- Use Case Status

##### Correspondence Rules for Use Case Models

Each use case model should eventually be linked to the CDM data concepts that are needed to implement the Information Requirements defined bty the use case. These linkages are stored within CDM by associating each required data concept to the use case(s) that use them.

#### Operations for Naming Use Cases

Use cases should be named so that users can easily search and find use cases within a long list. This document recommends using a standard list of subdomains for each domain. For example, in the case of the ITS domain, use cases should be categorized according to the services groupings defined in ISO 14813-1.

#### Correspondence Rules for Use Case Views

The use case view includes the following correspondence rules with other views and resources:

- Domains should be defined in a separately maintained list
- Actors should be defined in a separately maintained list
- The source should cite a publicly available document
- The information flow class diagram shall be a diagram showing only those elements from the Information View that are relevant to this use case

#### Model Kinds

The Information Viewpoint consists of the following model kinds:

- Class Specification Model Kind
- Property Specification Model Kind, which is used for both:
	- Object Property 
	- Data Property
- Class Diagram Model Kind, which is used for 
	- Information Flow Class Diagrams
	- Subject Area Class Diagrams
	- Interface Traceability Class Diagrams

#### Class Specification Model Kind

The class specification model kind is a template that is used to provide formal definitions of each class within the CDM.

##### Conventions

The template for the class specification is defined as follows; all information is presented in series other than the Class Name, which is used as the page title:

|Field|Description|Conformance|
|-----|-----------|-----------|
| **Name** |Name of class within its defined context<br /> \<Context\>::\<Name\><br />The context and name should be in UpperCamelCase. Multiple levels of context are allowed (e.g., "\<Context\>::\<Context\>::\<Name\>")|Mandatory|
| **Subclass Of** |Normatively identifies a more general class from which this class inherits properties |Optional|
| **Definition** |Textual definition of the class in English|Mandatory|
|**Class Diagram Description**|An English description of the relationships defined for this class.|
|**Specification** |Formalized Manchester Syntax representation of the definition|Optional|
|**Required by Use Case(s)**|Link(s) to use case(s) where this data concept is used |Conditional (if exists)|
|**CDM References**|Identifies other classes and properties that reference this class.|Optional|
|**Sources**|The source(s) considered when developing the class|Optional|
| **Status** |Status of the data concept per the states defined in the Governance document.|Mandatory|
|**Has Subclass(es)** |Classes that further specialize this class |Conditional (if exists)|
|**Annotations**|Meta-data about the class that should be contained in formalized presentations of the class definition. Valid annotations are defined at https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-syntax/#Annotation_Properties and include: <ul><li>rdfs:comment</li><li>rdfs:isDefinedBy</li><li>rdfs:label</li><li>rdfs:seeAlso</li><li>owl:backwardCompaticbleWith</li><li>owl:incompatibleWith</li><li>owl:priorVersion</li><li>owl:versionInfo</li></ul>|Optional|
|**Manchester Syntax Specification**|Formalized list of properties, restrictions, and values for the class|Optional|
|**Supplementary Figures**|Figures that support the definition of the class|Optional|

##### Operations for Class Specifiactions

When initially creating a class specification, the following fields shall be populated, as a minimum, prior to considering the specification complete:

- Name
- Definition
- Status

###### Customizing a Class

Classes may be extended by defining a new class and identifying the original class with a SubclassOf relationship. This may be done within the CDM or in custom implementations.

##### Correspondence Rules for Class Specifications

Each class specification should eventually be linked to:

- The use case(s) that rely upon the class
- The generalized classes from which the class is derived
- The specialized classes that derive from the class
- The properties that have been identified for the class

##### Example

The following text provides an example of how a Class Specification might appear within the CDMRA. Terms shown as hyperlinks would be linked to other appropriate pages within the CDMRA; however, as this is just an example, those links are not active.

#### Property Specification Model Kind

The property specification model kind is a template that is used to provide formal definitions of each property within the CDM. The CDM maintains separate lists for object properties and data properties, but both use the same template.

##### Conventions

The template for the property specification is defined as follows; all information is presented in series other than the Property Name, which is used as the page title:

|Field|Description|Conformance|
|-----|-----------|-----------|
|**Name**|Fully-qualified name of property (i.e., indicating any specializations)<br /> The name should be in lowerCamelCase.|Mandatory|
|**SubpropertyOf**|Normatively identifies a more general property from which this class inherits characteristics|Optional|
|**Definition**|Textual definition of the property in English|Mandatory|
|**Required by Use Case(s)**|Link(s) to use case(s) where this property is used|Optional|
|**CDM References**|Link(s) to classes that include this property and properties that further specialize this property|Optional|
|**Interface Specification References**|Link(s) to interface specifications that use this data|Optional|
|**Sources**|The source(s) considered when developing the property|Optional|
|**Status** |Status of the data concept per the states defined in the Governance document.|Mandatory|
|**Has SubProperties**|A list of the properties that further specialize this property|Optional|
|**Annotations**|Meta-data about the property that should be contained in formalized presentations of the definition. Valid annotations are defined at https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-syntax/#Annotation_Properties and include: <ul><li>rdfs:comment</li><li>rdfs:isDefinedBy</li><li>rdfs:label</li><li>rdfs:seeAlso</li><li>owl:backwardCompaticbleWith</li><li>owl:incompatibleWith</li><li>owl:priorVersion</li><li>owl:versionInfo</li></ul>|Optional|
|**Property Specification**|Formalized Manchester Syntax representation of the definition|Optional|
|**Supplementary Figures**|Figures that support the definition of the property|Optional|

##### Operations

When initially creating a property specification, the following fields shall be populated, as a minimum, prior to considering the specification complete:

- Name
- Definition
- Status

##### Correspondence Rules

Each property specification should eventually be linked to:

- The use case(s) that rely upon the property
- The generalized property from which the property is derived
- The specialized properties that derive from the property
- The classes that have the property as a characteristic

##### Example

The following text provides an example of how a Property Specifiaction might appear within the CDMRA. Terms shown as hyperlinks would be linked to other appropriate pages within the CDMRA; however, as this is just an example, those links are not active.

#### Class Diagram Model Kind

The class diagram model kind defines the conventions and rules for graphically illustrating portions of the City Data Model (CDM). While class diagrams are useful representations, it must be understood that the CDM is a single logical data model that incorporates all of the data concepts contained within the CDMRA and that the individual class diagrams are merely snapshots of the larger model. This is similar to the concept of a set of building plans, which are drawn in two-dimensions but represent a 3-dimensional entity. Changing one diagram is likely to have impacts elsewhere within the overall set of plans and should not be performed without careful consideration. 

Due to the scope and size of this model, it is envisioned that virtually all systems that incorprate data defined by the CDM will simplify the model into a physical data model to meet practical system needs (e.g., for coding, processing, and memory efficiency).

The class diagram model kind defines the set of conventions to be used in illustrating information but there are four specializations of the class diagram model kind that focus on presenting slightly different information:

- The information flow class diagram model kind is a class diagram model kind that illustrates the relationships among the data that is exchanged as a part of an information flow, which is described within a use case. This model kind is part of both the Use Case View and Information View.
- The subject area class diagram model kind is a class diagram model kind that illustrates the relationships among the data that are part of a defined data subject area (e.g., describing all properties of a particular class, regardless of use). This model kind is part of the Information View.
- The interface specification traceability class diagram model kind is a class diagram model kind that illustrates how data defined in a specific interface specification traces to the data  defined within the CDM. This model kind is part of both the Information View and the Interface Specification View.
- The interface specification class diagram model kind is a class diagram model kind that illustrates the relationships among the data that are part of a specific interface specification. This model kind is part of the Interface Specification View.


##### Conventions

All four of the class diagram model kinds used by the Information View shall conform to the conventions of the Ontology Definition Metamodel (ODM) version 1.1 profile for the Web Ontology Language (OWL) (i.e., Section 14 of ODM v1.1). In addition, the models are allowed to show traceability from Interface Specification artifacts (e.g., classes and attributes) to artifacts within the CDM using the <<trace>> association defined by the Unified Modeling Language (UML).

Properties may be depicted in any of the three formats allowed by ODM v1.1 (i.e., as an an attribute, an association role, or an association class). However, except when displaying relationships among properties, it is strongly recommended to 

- show data properties as attributes and object properties as associations
- show each property the same way in all diagrams such that the diagrams represent a single, coherent UML model

##### Operations

CDM diagrams should generally contain no more than twenty classes to promote understandability of the diagram.

##### Correspondence Rules

Each class contained within a CDM diagram should be associated with its own Subject Area Class Diagram Model.

### Interface Specification Viewpoint

#### Overview

The Interface Specification Viewpoint frames how stakeholder concerns related to interface specifications will be addressed, especially those related to understanding relationships between data defined in interface specifications and data defined in the CDM.

#### Stakeholders

The Interface Specification Viewpoint considers concerns from the following stakeholders:

1. Data custodians
2. Data stewards
3. Designers, developers, and integrators
4. System managers
5. Users, including
	1. End users
	2. Field support users
	3. System operators
	4. Administrative users
	5. Maintainers
	6. Testers
	7. Standardization bodies
	8. Privacy advocates

#### Concerns

The following table identifies the stakeholder concerns considered in the development of this viewpoint. Each concern is categorized into a generalized topic area and includes a reference to the model kind where the concern is addressed.

|Concern|Addressed by Model Kind|
|-------|-----------------------|
|What interface specifications use the data covered by the CDM?|Traceability class diagram model kind|
|How can data be transformed between the formats defined by an interface specification and the CDM?|Interface specification model kind|
|Where is the data in my interface specification covered by the CDM?|Traceability class diagram model kind|
|What data is defined in interface specifications?|Interface class diagram model kind|

#### Concerns not addressed

#### Class Diagram Model Kind

The interface class diagram model kind and traceability class diagram model kind conform to the class diagram model kind definition as presented in the Infomation View.

Interface specifications, even when based on object-oriented models, typically have constraints that will result in differences between their models and the CDM. The CDM will tend to have multiple layers of abstraction and complexity that need to be avoided in software deployments for practical reasons. There may also be differences due to differences in presentation needs, accuracy needs, legacy issues, etc. These differences necessitate a mapping between the defined interface specifications and a common logical model. By mapping all interface specifications to a common logical model, data transformations can more easily be achieved among any two interface specifications.

#### Interface Specification Model Kind

The interface specification model kind defines the details about how data concepts are traced from an interface specification to CDM data concepts.

##### Conventions

The template for an traceability specification is defined as follows:

|Field|Description|Conformance|
|-----|-----------|-----------|
| **Interface Specification Name** |Name of the specification. |Mandatory|
| **Specification Identifier** |The identifier of the specification. |Optional|
| **Interface URL** |The URL for the interface specification|Optional|
| **Description** |Short explanation of the interface specification, such as an abstract |Mandatory|
| **Traceability** |Table with columns that identify 1) the interface specification data concept, 2) the corresponding CDM data concept, 3) the transformation rule to convert from the interface specification to the CDM data; this can be presented as a textual explantion or as a formula where x is the value of the interface specification data concept and the equation solves for the CDM data concept and 4) the status of the traceability rule|
| **Specification License** |Indicate the owner of the traceability rules and provide a reference to the copyright information|Mandatory|
| **Other Licensing Notes**|Additional information related to licensing|Optional|
| **Supplementary Figures** |One or more illustrations that might assist the user in better understanding the scenario. Each illustration should be explained by either the description or the flow of events.|Optional|

##### Operations

Each interface specification identified in the CDMRA should have an interface specification model that identifies the traceability of all interface specification data concepts that trace to CDM data concepts.

_Update the governance document to show that drafts can have PNG/JPG diagrams of figures embedded while approved items need to be entered into a central model that is linked to._

_Use Enterprise Architect as the central model (with exports to XMI)_

##### Correspondence Rules

Elements from the interface specifiaction should correspond to elements of the CDM.
